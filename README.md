## 🚀 Introduction

Logistic Regression is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for classification problems.
It predicts the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class using the logistic (sigmoid) function.

In this project, Logistic Regression is applied to a dataset (e.g., predicting if a student passes, customer churn, or fraud detection).

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

1. **Importing Libraries** – NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning, encoding, splitting into train/test sets
3. **Model Training** – Logistic Regression from `sklearn.linear_model`
4. **Model Evaluation** – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
5. **Visualization** – Decision boundaries and confusion matrix heatmap

## 📈 Results

* **Accuracy:** ~/0.89%
* Confusion Matrix and ROC curve are plotted for better insights.

Example confusion matrix:

|              | Predicted 0 | Predicted 1 |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Actual 0** | TN          | FP          |
| **Actual 1** | FN          | TP          |
